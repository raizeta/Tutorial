#array_flip â€” Exchanges all keys with their associated values in an array
array array_flip ( array $array )

array_flip() returns an array in flip order, i.e. keys from array become values 
and values from array become keys.

Note that the values of array need to be valid keys, i.e. they need to be either integer or string. 
A warning will be emitted if a value has the wrong type, 
and the key/value pair in question will not be included in the result.

If a value has several occurrences, the latest key will be used as its value, 
and all others will be lost.

#Example ONe
$input = array("oranges", "apples", "pears");
$flipped = array_flip($input);

print_r($flipped);
Array
(
    [oranges] => 0
    [apples] => 1
    [pears] => 2
)

#Example Two, With Collisson
$input = array("a" => 1, "b" => 1, "c" => 2);
$flipped = array_flip($input);

print_r($flipped);

Array
(
    [1] => b
    [2] => c
)
