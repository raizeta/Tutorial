Interface is an empty class which contains only the declaration of methods. So any class which implements this interface must contain the declared functions in it. So, interface is nothing but a strict ruling, which helps to extend any class and strictly implement all methods defined in interface. A class can use any interface by using the implements keyword. Please note that in interface you can only declare
methods, but you cannot write their body. That means the body of all methods
must remain blank.
